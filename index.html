    In my childhood, I was highly interested in science. I used to spend hours conducting experiments at home, eagerly attempting to create gadgets and understand the principles behind them. As I grew older, my curiosity expanded beyond the realm of science. I delved into various subjects, with a notable exploration into the stock market in Nepal and India. Subsequently, I ventured into the complex world of forex trading.

    However, my journey took an intriguing turn as I rediscovered my initial passion for technology and science. Armed with a more robust plan, I am now dedicated to mastering the basics of Python. This learning journey is complemented by my commitment to sharing the knowledge I acquire with others, fostering a community of learners.
